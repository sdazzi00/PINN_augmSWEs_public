# PINNs for the 1D augmented system of SWEs

This Python code is used to solve the 1D Shallow Water Equations (SWE) with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) using NVIDIA Modulus.

It was developed for the test cases presented in Dazzi (2024).

**Reference:** Dazzi S. (2024). Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Augmented System of Shallow Water Equations with Topography. Paper submitted to *Water Resources Research*.

The code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.
